Emergency Raccoon!
=================

This is the code behind <http://www.emergencyraccoon.com/>. It's an HTML page
with some JavaScript. Because trash pandas are simple like that.

This is a fork of rgrove's "emergency kitten".  https://github.com/rgrove/emergencykitten

I claim no responsibility for the code here, it's all his with extremely minor modifications.

Installing
----------

1. Clone this git repo (fork it first if you plan to make changes).

        $ git clone git://github.com/trekkie1701c/emergencyraccoon.git

2. Open `index.html` in a browser and you should see Emergency Raccoon!
